# Web Template

A template for building web applications.

## Intentions

- Keep up with recent technologies.
- Provide a base any application can work from; avoid opinionated decisions such as mobx vs redux.
- Leave everything open to extensibility.
- Put "best practices" in place, but do not assert them as the rule.

## Getting Started

```
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Running in development mode
$ npm run dev

# Building for production
# This will remove the `dist` directory
$ npm run build
```
