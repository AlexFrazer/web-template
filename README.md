# Web Template

A quick template I use for making front end applications.

Everyone is completely free to borrow from, fork, or use this template. You can copy it freely.
I put it on GitHub as a quick demonstration of how I would develop a modern web application.

This falls more under the "comprehensive" category than the "lightweight" category. Keep that in mind.

## What it demonstrates

- [Atomic Design](https://medium.com/@yejodido/atomic-components-managing-dynamic-react-components-using-atomic-design-part-1-5f07451f261f#.nm38cfqbw)
- [Animations via Velocity](https://github.com/twitter-fabric/velocity-react)
- [Async/Await](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/10/asyncawait-the-hero-javascript-deserved.html)

## Resources I used


## Usage

```
