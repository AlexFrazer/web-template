# Web Template

A template for building web applications. Uses React as the main front end framework.

## Intentions

- Keep up-to-date with most recent technologies
- Provide a basic outline that anyone can work from regardless of their stack -- avoid making decisions such as mobx vs redux.
- Keep a small and manageable bundle
- No back end. This is mostly for front end engineers.

## Getting Started

```
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Running in development mode
$ npm run dev

# Building for production
# This will remove the `dist` directory
$ npm run build
```
